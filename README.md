## Contribution & Git Guidelines

To maintain a clean and organized repository, please follow these steps:

1. **Branching**

   - Always create a new branch for your work:  
     `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
   - Use descriptive names like `feature/event-page` or `fix/navbar-bug`.

2. **Pull Before You Push**

   - Sync with the main branch before starting:  
     `git pull origin main`
   - This prevents conflicts and keeps your branch up to date.

3. **Commit Best Practices**

   - Make small, focused commits.
   - Use clear messages in the format:  
     `Add feature: description` or `Fix bug: description`.

4. **Push Changes**

   - Push your branch to your fork:  
     `git push origin feature/your-feature`

5. **Pull Requests**

   - Open a Pull Request to the main repository.
   - Include a brief description of what your changes do.
   - Attach screenshots or demos if UI changes are involved.

6. **Code Review & Cleanup**
   - Review your code for formatting and responsiveness.
   - Remove any unnecessary console logs or commented code.

Following these steps ensures smooth collaboration and keeps the repository organized.
